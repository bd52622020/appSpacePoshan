map() is the transformation that takes a function and applied the function to each element of the input RDD. The result of the function will become the value of each element in the reulst RDD.
 
flatMap()
flatMap() is the transformation that takes a function and applies the function to each elements of the RDD as in map().
The differenct is that flapMap will retunr multiple values for each elements in the source RDD
